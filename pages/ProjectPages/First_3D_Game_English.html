        <div class="projects-explanation">
            This was the First 3D project I made with Unity. I'd worked only once with Unity before,
            which was a 2D game. So I was completely new to this. I decided to Create a semi open
            world with different areas and a few enemies.
            <br>
            <br>
            In order to make this work I had to learn the following skills:

            <ul>
                <li>Terraforming</li>
                <li>The very basics of 3D movement</li>
                <li>Audio</li>
                <li>unity Basics</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Terraforming</h3>
            With terraforming I Mean Creating te Layout of the map. To do
            this I got to learn a few tools within unity. This gave me the
            ability to learn how to create my own basic world.

            <h3>The very basics of 3D movement</h3>
            Since this is the first time I ever worked within 3D environment,
            I had to learn the basics of 3D compared to 2d. After watching a
            few tutorials I managed to create a working movement script.

            <h3>Audio</h3>
            I wanted to add some music and sounds to my silent world to make
            it feel a bit more alive. So added borders so every region had
            it own sound.

            <h3>unity Basics</h3>
            Since I was still very inexperienced with Unity, I had to learn
            a lot about Unity itself. So over time I got to understand the
            editor a bit better. With these basics i created a good base for
            upcoming projects.
