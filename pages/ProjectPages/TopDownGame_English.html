    <div class="projects-explanation">
      This game was purely created on in-game features and so the
      visuals are lacking. This is done purposely to reduce the time
      I have to spent on visuals instead of coding.
      <br>
      <br>
      I learned the following skills during this project:

      <ul>
        <li>Self-made animations</li>
        <li>Movement</li>
        <li>Enemy drop items</li>
        <li>Inheritance</li>
        <li>Unity events</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Self-made animations</h3>
      Even though I don't have a lot of visuals in this project. For
      my sword slashing to work I had to make my own animation. Before
      Working with this I wasn't this feature excited within Unity. So
      after now having worked with it, I could solve a few problems I
      had with earlier projects of mine.

      <h3>Movement</h3>
      For me, it felt like it felt like top-down movement was a lot
      different from regular 2D movement. Also having de player face
      the mouse at all times was something I never used before.

      <h3>Enemy drop items</h3>
      For this game I had the idea to not make score increase by killing
      an enemy, but by picking up a coin they drop on death. For this
      to work I just used the same code as I use for the enemy spawners.

      <h3>Inheritance</h3>
      Even though I have used inheritance a lot more throughout different
      projects, this is the first time I used it while being aware what
      inheritance is. So I implemented it a lot more and better within
      this project.

      <h3>Unity events</h3>
      While following a tutorial, I came across Unity events. I had never
      used these before, but as soon as I learned about their existence I
      knew could use them quite a lot. So I later implemented them wherever
      I could.
