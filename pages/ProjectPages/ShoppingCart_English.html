                This school project all about learning the basics of JavaScript.
                Since it was mainly focused on JS, it wasn't necessary to go all
                out with css. So I kept the CSS to minimal and put my time into JS.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before this I had very limited experience with JS. So this
                exercise was actually of huge help to me.
                <br>
                <br>
                I learned the following skills during this project:

                <ul>
                    <li>Change HTML through JS</li>
                    <li>Variables</li>
                    <li>Creating functions</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Change HTML through JS</h3>
                I learned how to change text or styling of HTML components. not
                only through instant change but also if for example you press a
                button or if a certain requirement is met.

                <h3>Variables</h3>
                Although this isn't the first time working with variables, I never
                used them in JS. So by seeing it work on a webpage was kinda fun.
                This also opens a lot of new possibilities for making certain things
                with HTML and CSS.

                <h3>Creating functions</h3>
                The functions we had to make for this exercise were really simple
                and easy. But it was a nice way to learn how to combine JS Function
                into your webpage.
