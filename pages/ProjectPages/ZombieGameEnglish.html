                During this project, I had to challenge myself to learn a lot of new things.
                The purpose of this project was to create a zombies game where there would
                spawn endless enemies from multiple points on the map.
                <br>
                <br>
                In order to make this work I had to learn the following skills:

                <ul>
                    <li>Raycasting</li>
                    <li>Spawn Points</li>
                    <li>HP System</li>
                    <li>Stamina System</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Raycasting</h3>
                Although used in earlier projects, it was something I didn't
                really understand until this project. Within this project I
                used the raycast for shooting.

                <h3>Spawn Points</h3>
                For this to work I had to learn how to instantiate objects. With
                this I had already created a spawner. So I copied and pasted a
                few of them throughout the map and that part was done.

                <h3>HP System</h3>
                With a working HP system comes damage. So for this to work I
                had to assign damage to the enemy and the player. After linking
                up the scripts I was able to get everything working properly.

                <h3>Stamina System</h3>
                For the stamina system I had to make my own timer. By simply
                checking the time and depleting the stamina every second it worked.
                After I got that working I also added extra stamina drain if you
                jump.
