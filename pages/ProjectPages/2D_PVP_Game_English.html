    <div class="projects-explanation">
      During this project, I had to challenge myself to learn a lot of new things.
      The purpose of this project was to create a game where two players could battle
      each other and have one player win.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to make this work I had to learn the following skills:

      <ul>
        <li>Animation</li>
        <li>A working menu</li>
        <li>Apply and Improve</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Animation</h3>
      During this project we got to lessons about animations, so
      I used this project to test the things that I learned. Since
      there were quite a few features I added to the players, I had a
      lot to animate. It took me a really long time to get all the
      animations working properly, but in the end it all worked.

      <h3>A working menu</h3>
      To Make the game feel more like a real and complete game, I
      chose add a menu. Because I had never made this before, I had to
      watch a few tutorials to get it to work. It turned out to be
      a lot easier than imagined. But there's a first time for everything.

      <h3>Apply and Improve</h3>
      During this project I applied a lot of skills I learned during
      previous projects. A lot of them were greatly improved upon while
      working on this project. A good example is movement. The movement
      in this game is a lot more advanced then in previous works of mine.
