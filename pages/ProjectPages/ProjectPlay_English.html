    <div class="projects-explanation">
      During this project, I had to challenge myself to learn a lot of new things.
      The purpose of this project was to create a game together with a group. We
      decided to go with a 2D dungeon escape concept.
      <br>
      <br>
      In order to make this work I had to learn the following skills:

      <ul>
        <li>Team work</li>
        <li>Linking scripts</li>
        <li>collectable system</li>
        <li>enemy movement</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Team work</h3>
      This project was made with the intention of learning how to
      work in a team. So my team existed of 4 designers and 2 coders.
      As coders, we had to communicate with the designers and with each
      other in order to make this project work. I think we did a great
      job working together and the final product was completely finished.

      <h3>Linking scripts</h3>
      We linked our project with GitHub, so we could share the scripts
      and game scenes more easily. To prevent any merging errors we
      decided to work in our own scene. We also worked on different
      scripts to make sure everything worked out fine.

      <h3>collectable system</h3>
      For our dungeon escape game we decided to create collectables with
      different values. We managed to get the scripts working as intended.
      With the collection system working we put the current and max score
      on the screen.

      <h3>enemy movement</h3>
      Because of the zombie game I made, I already had a bit of knowledge
      when it came to enemy movement. But in this game we added a few extra
      features to the enemies movement to make the game a bit more interesting.
